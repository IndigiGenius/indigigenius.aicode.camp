    "## How should we be collecting data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be respectful. Whatever you are collecting data on, be aware of what, or who, you are being disruptive to when collecting that data.\n",
    "* Write down what you’re taking a picture, then take a picture of that label so that we have a bookmark of all the images after that in the phone gallery.\n",
    "* As you take pictures, organize them into folders while we’re out in the field, this will make organizing much easier later on, not needed at all.\n",
    "* Use consistent name conventions on the phone and in our folders on the computer. Make your folder names understandable for yourself later. Don't rely on your memory.\n",
    "* Image variety is going to be important, so take a lot of photos.\n",
    "    * Use *burst mode* in the camera app. On android phones this can be done by holding down the `volume down` button, or holding and sliding the take picture button.\n",
    "    * Get images from different angles. As you are taking pictures using burst mode, move the phone around.\n",
    "    * Take pictures of different objects, but of the same type. So for plants, get pictures of multiple plants of the same species (they usually grow nearby).\n",
    "    * It’s ok if the pictures are blurry, but we do want some in focus.\n",
    "    * Get pictures with different backgrounds. If some of the plants are going near exposed dirt, and others are growing around a lot of grass, get images of both types.\n",
    "* Include some pictures with hands, shadows, and people.\n",
    "* Possibly held or in the ground/stationary.\n",
    "* Consider a category of images that is “background”."
